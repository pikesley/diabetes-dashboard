Right now it shows:\r\n\r\n* Daily, weekly and 30-day blood-glucose graphs and averages\r\n* Weekly breakfast, lunch, dinner and bedtime medication graphs and averages\r\n\r\nThere'll be a lot more sophisticated stuff here once I've worked out Coffeescript and [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/)\r\n\r\n# Deployment\r\n\r\nThis is a straight-up Rack app, it should deploy right onto Heroku. The Heroku environment will need to know about \r\n\r\n* `METRICS_API_USERNAME` and \r\n* `METRICS_API_PASSWORD` \r\n\r\nto access the Pancreas API (you'll have set these [here](http://pancreas-api.herokuapp.com/#dropbox-integration)), and \r\n\r\n* `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` and\r\n* `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`\r\n\r\nwhich will allow you into the dashboard\r\n\r\n# Dashing is awesome\r\n\r\nSee [http://shopify.github.com/dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing) for more on Dashing\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
